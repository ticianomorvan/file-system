# file-system

A basic implementation of some known UNIX commands around the file system. The main driver for this project is just to practice C programming and further UNIX knowledge.

## Roadmap / Ideas

### Commands
- [ ] `ls` command
- [ ] `cat` command
- [ ] `head` command
- [ ] `tail` command
- [ ] `cp` command
- [ ] `mv` command
- [ ] `rm` command
- [ ] `wc` command
- [ ] `diff` command
- [ ] `mkdir` command
- [ ] `pwd` command
- [ ] `cd` command
- [ ] `du` command

### Features / Considerations
- [ ] command `flags` (e.g. `ls -U` doesn't sort directory entries)
- [ ] one-to-many command approach (e.g. `fs list`, instead of `ls`)
- [ ] don't rely on third-party libraries, do most of the work with C Standard Library.
